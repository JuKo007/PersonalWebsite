At GESIS, I'm part of the [Designed Digital Data](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science) team, focusing on providing
an easy to use, transparent and secure infrastructure for collecting mobile survey and smartphone usage data for social science research.

As a PhD student at Ulm University, I am part of the [molecular psychology lab](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/psy-mp/) and investigate how interpersonal relationships can be quantified using chat logs, specifically donated WhatsApp chat logs. I am developing interactive methods for transparent data donations, and investigate how social relationships are expressed through different communication patterns.
