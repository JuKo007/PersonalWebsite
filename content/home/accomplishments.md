   description: "This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.       Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural            networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best       practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw     from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart          robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database     mining, and other areas."

   url: "https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools"
   description: "In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. The          course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with. There are two         components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge.      The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program like version control, markdown, git,          GitHub, R, and RStudio."
